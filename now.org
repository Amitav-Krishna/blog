- Right now I'm working on [[https://amitav.net/roadmap-llm.html][building an LLM]] from scratch.
- I'm also trying to use transformers to denoise quantum sensor readings. Heavily inspired by [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16242][this paper]] using CNNs to denoise quantum sensor readings and [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06287][this paper]] on creating physics-informed networks.
