* Building an LLM from scratch in C++ 


Hello! This is part 1 in a =TBD= part series on creating an LLM from scratch! Part 2 can be found [[https://amitav.net/building-matrices-and-vectors][here]].

In this document I will be talking about how I'll be approaching this. This project is currently in progress, so for now it'll be mostly high-level, and as I go through it I'll update it with more detail and links to relevant articles.

** Math & Linear Algebra Foundations
- [[https://amitav.net/building-lists.html][Lists]], [[https://amitav.net/building-vectors.html][vectors]], and [[https://amitav.net/building-matrices.html][matrices]].
- Randomness

** Neurons, Chain Rule, and Autodiff

** Optimization & Training Mechanics

** Probabilistic Language Modeling

** Embeddings and a (Tiny) Transformer
